The computing landscape today spans desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, creating a demand for versatile, lightweight operating systems that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance usability and user experience.

jinOs@ai aims to develop a minimal yet powerful OS that:  
- Includes a **custom-built kernel** written in **C** and optionally **Rust** for safety and efficiency.  
- Supports multi-architecture hardware (x86_64 for desktops/laptops and ARM64 for smartphones/tablets).  
- Runs Android applications through a runtime or container layer for a rich app ecosystem.  
- Features a modern GUI built with **Flutter** or **Qt** for cross-device usability.  
- Integrates an AI assistant inspired by Tony Stark’s Jarvis, capable of local and remote AI processing depending on hardware capabilities.  
- Supports a multi-language user space environment: **C, C++, Go, Python**, providing flexibility for system services, AI, and applications.

This project will be collaboratively developed by our team, combining expertise in systems programming, AI, and application development.

## 3. Objectives

- Develop a **custom OS kernel** in C and Rust focusing on portability, modularity, and performance.  
- Implement Android app compatibility via containerization or runtime layers.  
- Create a cross-platform GUI using Flutter or Qt.  
- Integrate AI modules using Python (for rapid prototyping) and Rust/C++ (for performance).  
- Build system services and daemons in C, C++, and Go.  
- Design an installer and update mechanism.

---

## 4. Scope

- **Supported Devices:** Desktops/laptops (x86_64), smartphones/tablets (ARM64).  
- **Languages:** Kernel (C, Rust), user space (C, C++, Go, Python), GUI (Flutter/Qt).  
- **Excluded:** Embedded IoT devices and WebOS in this phase.  
- **Features:** Kernel, Android compatibility, GUI, AI assistant, system services, installation/update tools.

## 6. Methodology and Spiral Timeline

The development of jinOs@ai will follow an iterative spiral model, with multiple cycles of planning, development, testing, and refinement. Each iteration will produce a working version of the OS with progressively increasing functionality, ensuring continuous progress and early delivery of features.

### Notes:

- Each iteration delivers a **working product** with increasing complexity and usability.
- Early iterations focus on kernel and core system stability.
- Middle iterations expand on user space, GUI, and compatibility.
- Later iterations refine AI features and deployment mechanisms.
- Team members will collaborate and focus on assigned modules, integrating regularly.
